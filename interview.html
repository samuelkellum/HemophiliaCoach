<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MicroHealth:</span> Angela, what is your background working with the MicroHealth app?&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Angela:</span> I work with a Hemophilia Treatment Center (HTC) and have been enrolling and monitoring patients on the MicroHealth app for over 5 years. I follow our patients on the app, working with adherence and responding to their bleeds. Many of our patients love messaging through the app when they have a need or just to check-in. Over the years I have seen many other apps for hemophilia, but I find the MicroHealth app to be both the easiest for patients to use + providing information needed by the care team.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MicroHealth:</span> What gave you the idea to work with patients outside of your HTC through the MicroHealth app?&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Angela:</span> One evening I received a text notification from MicroHealth that a patient of ours had logged a bleed. By the description the patient included, I realized it was likely an iliopsoas bleed which requires emergency attention. The patient did not understand the seriousness of this bleed and planned to have it checked out the next day. My team and I jumped into action to care for him. I kept thinking, &ldquo;What if this patient did not have someone responding to him as we were?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This event weighed heavily on my mind and the following day I spoke with Marc Lara, also a pharmacist and a co-founder of MicroHealth. Marc told me many patients who log on MicroHealth are not connected to a health care provider as our patients are. I told Marc, &ldquo;I want to help these patients, too!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MicroHealth:</span> In addition to providing education about serious bleeds, what else will you do to help patients as a Coach?&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Angela:</span> I already knew from a published study that patients who are followed by their health care team through the app have decreased annualized bleed rates (ABR) from improved adherence. I told Marc perhaps I could work with patients who are not connected to their care team with adherence to decrease their ABR as well. That&rsquo;s when MicroHealth asked to hire me as a &ldquo;Coach&rdquo; to do just that!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>(Note: MicroHealth coaching is not connected with healthcare provided by a Hemophilia Treatment Center. Coaching and education through MicroHealth is provided independently and is not to replace a patient&rsquo;s medical care by their own physician. Care Teams can receive information about setting up their own MicroHealth professional account by emailing: help@microhealth.org).</em></p>
