    <p>Angela Kellum began working with the hemophilia community in 2016 when she was asked to help establish the pharmacy for the
    Tulane Hemophilia Treatment Center (HTC). She is an active member of the clinical bleeding disorder team and is involved
    with all interdisciplinary clinical activities for HTC including participation in Comprehensive Care Clinic visits. She
    has been instrumental in launching the HTC’s use of electronic infusion logs and care monitoring through the Center’s
    adoption of the MicroHealth app. She has co-authored publications regarding digital health and monitoring. She educates
    other pharmacists across the country about bleeding disorders and their treatment by speaking for various pharmaceutical
    manufactures, state and local pharmacists associations, and the Hemophilia Alliance. She also serves on several
    pharmaceutical advisory boards. Angela and her son created a program to determine the optimal vial combinations to fill
    prescriptions for clotting factor, and that program is now used in hospitals and pharmacies across the country. To help
    better care for her patients, Angela recently completed a program through the National Society of Health Coaches and was
    awarded the distinction of certified Health Coach, “CHC”.</p>
