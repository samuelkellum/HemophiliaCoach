    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MicroHealth&rsquo;s Digital Hemophilia Health Coach:</span> Dr. Kellum
        &ldquo;Angela&rdquo; has worked with the care team at a Hemophilia Treatment Center (HTC) for over 6 years. She
        meets with patients at their clinic appointments to review their bleeding disorder medications and address any
        questions or concerns. She collaborates on patients&rsquo; care with the hematologists, nurse specialists, social
        workers, physical therapist, and research coordinators. Angela was instrumental in launching her HTC&rsquo;s use of
        electronic infusion logs and care monitoring through the Center&rsquo;s adoption of the MicroHealth digital health
        app in 2017 and is the HTC&rsquo;s point person for the app. Between appointments, Angela connects with patients
        through the app to help with adherence and to address bleeds. She has co-authored, together with top hematologists,
        publications regarding digital health and monitoring. To help better care for her patients, Angela has attended
        group and private training on Motivational Interviewing and recently completed a program through the National
        Society of Health Coaches and was awarded the distinction of certified Health Coach, &ldquo;CHC&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Angela&rsquo;s background:</span> Angela began working at a corner drug
        store when she was 16 years old. She completed her Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy at the University of Louisiana at
        Monroe and her Doctor of Pharmacy at Samford University. She has a diverse pharmacy practice background, including
        working with retail and specialty pharmacies. Most of her pharmacy career was spent in hospital pharmacies working
        with Oncology (pediatric and adult), Adverse Drug Reactions, and Investigational Drug Studies.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>She joined the Louisiana Center for Bleeding &amp; Clotting Disorders in July 2016 to help establish and manage the
        Tulane University Health Sciences Pharmacy, the in-house 340B pharmacy for the HTC. Through this work of dispensing
        medication for patients, she recognized a need, and with her son, Samuel, created a program that determines the
        optimal vial combinations to most accurately fill prescriptions for clotting factors. This program helps both
        pharmacists and patients and is used in hospitals and pharmacies across the country.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Angela&rsquo;s Personal:</span> Angela lives in New Orleans and her
        favorite things include: stories (books &amp; movies), birds, bayous (cypress trees, turtles &amp; alligators), the
        Mississippi River &amp; its bridges, Cajun and Creole cuisine. She is married and has 2 sons, Charlie and Samuel.
