<p>Your Coach can be exactly who you need, and this could change for you over time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This may include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <strong>guide </strong>who helps you navigate challenges you may encounter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Guiding is an artful way your Coach&rsquo;s clinical experience and expertise can help you manage your condition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <strong>partner </strong>who really gets to know you, listens to you, and has time for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The relationship will be a sustained one-on-one interaction with someone who will learn and understand your history, your strengths, and your challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <strong>teacher </strong>who shares information, education, and resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your Coach has a library of bleeding disorder resources to share as you need or want the information. This may save you the time of searching through various websites to find what you want to know. Your Coach will provide information relevant to you and help ensure your understanding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <strong>cheerleader </strong>who provides encouragement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your Coach will recognize your past achievements, your current accomplishments, and will be there to cheer you on for your next win!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
