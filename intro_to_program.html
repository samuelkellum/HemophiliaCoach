<p><strong>What is Health Coaching?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span><strong>Health coaching </strong></span><span>is the use of
        evidence-based based skillful&nbsp;conversation, clinical strategies, and interventions to actively&nbsp;and
        safely engage patients/families/clients in health behavior&nbsp;change to better self-manage their health,
        health risk(s), and&nbsp;acute or chronic health conditions resulting in optimal wellness and recovery, improved
        health outcomes, lowered&nbsp;health risk and decreased health care costs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Health coaches are credentialed medical professionals using the client&rsquo;s condition and medical history to
    safely guide goal setting, and provide medical information as the need arises within the
    professional&rsquo;s&nbsp;scope of practice. This coaching style&nbsp;is highly personalized and
    promotes&nbsp;insight-driven behavior change to help&nbsp;patients better focus on their health and well-being.
    Furthermore, such a valuable&nbsp;resource could result in patients having&nbsp;increased satisfaction with
    their&nbsp;doctors/care team, medication, and overall care.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Digital Health Coaching </strong>is health coaching&nbsp;conveniently offered through an app. Digital Health
    Coaching can help easily and&nbsp;conveniently motivate patients and encourage them to become more engaged&nbsp;with
    their health and their life. With&nbsp;periodic check-ins, a digital health coaching&nbsp;program is designed to
    encourage long-term engagement and participation. Digital&nbsp;health coaching can be a great addition
    to&nbsp;existing disease management programs.</p>
